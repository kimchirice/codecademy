The goal is to improve the user experience of this ski lodge landing page. Currently, none of the clickable elements are very clear or offer good visual feedback to users.

## Tasks
  - [ ] 1. The site has basic styles laid out in starting.css. We’ve provided a blank style.css file for writing your own styles with less clutter, but feel free to write your CSS in whichever file you want. You shouldn’t need to edit the index.html file, but you can reference it and make changes if you need to. Before you begin, take a look through index.html to get acquainted with the site structure.

Start by creating some basic link color highlighting and hover state styling for all <a> tags. Open the hint below if you want to see how we implemented our styles. Throughout, we’ll provide examples of one possible way to implement the styling task, but there are essentially unlimited possible ways to solve each task!
